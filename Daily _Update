1.SDLC  ---> Software development life cycle.  


1.SDLC-Software Development Life Cycle-1)Planning And Requirement Analysis.2)Design 3) Implement 4) Test 5)Deploy 6)Maintenance

2.waterfall-The waterfall Model illustrates the software development process in a linear sequential flow.

Limitations of the Waterfall Life Cycle Model:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High amount of Risk and Uncertainty .

Agile: 
------------------------------------------------
Agile methodologies enable organizations to deliver value to customers faster and with fewer complications by systematically managing projects and developing software in an iterative fashion.
Differnt Between Waterfall and Agile:Waterfall model is linear process but Agile medhodologies designing and testing part is continuesing happening 
DevOps:is a basically a software development strategy which the  bridge between Dev side and Ops side of the company.its not a technology it ia s methodology .
DevOpS Stages:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A) Version Control :Maintain different version of the code-Suppose Emp 1 made a code and Empl 2 also made a code how will know at what time and whose made this in this case if we use version control tools like git will get this thinks.
B) Continues Integaration:Building your application Continuesly .that means developer made a change continuesly ,Continues Integaration should be pull the code and prepare a build

Linux Story:
----------------------------------------
Linux ia an Open Source Operating System Modelled On Unix And Developed in C Language.

Open Source:A) A Software Becomes open Source if Its Source Code is freely Available.

B) Tge Free Sofware movment was Started in 1983 And 1998.Some Developers Coined the term "Open-Source" to make it less ambigues

C) Open Source Projects are generally a collaborative effort by multiple sets of develpers to enhance the Productsand allow others to get benefits of it.

Features of Linux:
-------------------------
A) Linux is Open Source
B) Significantly reduces the Monitary cost
C)Huge Base if Developers that freely provide support
D)it is Reliable as it runs smoothly and no need to reboot it Repeatedly
E) Licensing freedom to re-Use and re-publishthe code 
can be customised if you want to change your systems look
New enhancements happening and updates come

Shell Scripting:

Shell Scripting is a series of shell  commands arranged in a text file to be executed one after the other.

similar to batch file in windows
Helps to automate asequence of task creating and also saves time.
Can be created using any normal text editor.
compiled like C/CPP progran,but are Interpreted  ditectly
Each shell script must have executable permission to runthe scrips.
 
 Creating a shell Script:
 
 ------------------------------------
 
 To Get into the root for Excute sudo-i
 Create a text file and add the extension of the shell # vi script.sh
 Enter some commands in the scripts to be executed echo "My first script echo $ (date)
 Change the permission of the script ,give it executeable permission and may also give read and execute permission for others users #chmod 755 scripts .sh
 Run the scripts 
 #./Scripts.sh
 # bash scripts .sh
 
 Creating a shell scripts:
 
 sudo-i
 # vi script.sh
 echo "My First scripts echo $ (date)
 #chmod 755 scripts
  #./Scripts.sh
 # bash scripts .sh
 
 Practical user of shell scripting:
 --------------------------------------
 
 data backup at regular interval of interval of time in the background
 To find out the number of users and their details
 Find details about various process and sorting them based on CPU usage ,runtime ,memory usage,users etc.
 To append each file with a signature ,date etc.
 For Schedulling tasks to be done at networks servers.
 creating new users by provding permission just by entering users.
 
 
 User Interface In Linux:
 -------------------------------
 
 Users interface is a visual part of opertaing system through which a user interactsw with a computer or a software
 
 Command line interface (CLI)
 
 Command line interface give commands in the form of lines of text to the program.
 The program which handle it is called a command language interpreter.
 
 User Interface in Linux:
 -----------------------------
 
 garphical user interface interacts with users with icons ,folders,wallpapers,widgets and visual indicates to make it easier for the user to access the program.
 
 For Linux,destop environment are KDF,GNOME,CINNAMON,MATE etc.
      .  Command line Interface( CLI)
      . Graphical user Interface ( GUI)   
      
      $ Cal --help or man
      ls -a 
      ls -r    -its showing reverse order
      ls -f-its showing alphabatic order files/name/template/picture
      ll-Long listing file-including hiding fil

What is the different btween apt and apt-get
what is apt:

apt Command in Linux. apt is a command-line utility for installing, updating, removing, and otherwise managing deb packages on Ubuntu, Debian, and related Linux distributions
 apt-get:
 ..............................
apt-get is a command line tool for interacting with the Advanced Package Tool (APT) library (a package management system for Linux distributions). It allows you to search for, install, manage, update, and remove software.

 The apt-get command is a full-featured but simplified interface to dpkg , and apt is a more user-friendly but slightly stripped-back version of apt-get .
 
 Control+d-denied next line.
 cat >file.txt- it is use to edit the file.
cat file.txt -n-to view the output if the file with number.
cat >>file.txt-to update the data in current file .
touch-to create the file.
vi-o work on the VI text editor, you have to know how to use the VI editor
Vim-Vim is an advanced and highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing.
tail-he tail command displays the last part (10 lines by default) of one or more files or piped data.
tail/head /less/more-all are file manipulation.
wc-word count
